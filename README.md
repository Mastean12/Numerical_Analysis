# Root-Finding Methods in Python

This project implements various numerical methods to find the roots of a given function using Python. The implemented methods include:

1. Bisection Method
2. Newton-Raphson Method
3. Fixed Point Iteration Method
4. Secant Method
5. False Position Method

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `math` module (standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mastean12/numerical_Analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd root-finding-methods
    ```

## Usage

Each method is implemented in a separate Python script. You can run each script individually and provide the required inputs when prompted.

### Bisection Method

To run the Bisection Method:
```bash
python ass.py
To run the Newton Raphson Method
python ass2.py
To Run the Fixed point method
python ass3.py
To run the Secant Method
python ass4.py
To run the False position Method
python ass5.py

Method Descriptions
Bisection Method
The Bisection Method is a root-finding method that repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which the root must lie for further processing.

Newton-Raphson Method
The Newton-Raphson Method uses the first derivative of the function to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.

Fixed Point Iteration Method
The Fixed Point Iteration Method solves the equation x = g(x) by iterating x_{n+1} = g(x_n) until convergence.

Secant Method
The Secant Method is similar to the Newton-Raphson Method but uses a sequence of secant lines to approximate the root, avoiding the need for derivative calculations.

False Position Method
The False Position Method, also known as the Regula Falsi Method, is a root-finding algorithm that combines the bisection method and linear interpolation.
